00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
 Are you fat? It's a simple yes to my question.

1
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
 If yes, you'll need a calorie deficit.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
 If no, you can bypass that and go straight to lifting weights.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
 But once you've determined your calorie deficit,

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
 you also need to lift weights.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:20,000
 And the next important question is, do you enjoy sport like proper sport, tennis or golf or jiu-jitsu or rugby or infeapple?

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
 If you like sport, and you play sport, you go straight to the high protein diet.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
 But if you don't like sport, you get about three and a half thousand step counts a day.

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
 Yeah, you're going to need some form of cardio.

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
 Now, that could be taking the stairs, increasing your step count, maybe getting on a cross-trainer.

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
 You could get on a spin bike, which is just cycling on a stationary bike with the brakes on.

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
 Or you could get a real bike, or you could go for a run, you could go jogging, you could train for your first 5K.

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
 You could even start swimming.

13
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
 But when it comes to determining what type of cardio you should be doing, is a very simple formula.

14
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
 Do you like the modality of training that you're doing?

15
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
 If you're not enjoying the type of cardio that you're doing, well that's a problem.

16
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
 And you need to go back up to the cardio stage and pick something that you actually enjoy.

17
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
 When it comes to people sustaining and adhering stuff, humans don't like to do things they don't want to do.

18
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
 And if they do do things they don't want to do, they don't do it very long.

19
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:14,000
 But if you are finding a bit of cardio you like and you do enjoy it, well, you get to come over to the high protein diet section.

20
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
 Which is about 1 to 2 grams of protein per day.

21
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,000
 And also, if you are obese, you can go 1 gram of protein per centimeter in height.

22
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
 And now you think we're a carbohydrate some fats.

23
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
 Well, if you're a quake protein and you're quake calories, whether you go high carb, or low fat,

24
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
 doesn't make a difference for far loss.
